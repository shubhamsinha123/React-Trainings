# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- TO go live via github hosting -->

initialize your project(react) using `git init`

Make sure you are running a build version since you are going to host react server (3000 by default) to any live/public host.

For that, `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

`npm run deploy` or `yarn run deploy` for build

you have to go to your git repo settings and under page, make ur site and publish it.

after that initialize that git repo to your react local or in simple git clone in the local

after that, in package.json, we have to do something:

"homepage": "https://username.github.io/repo/"

and add one major thing,

npm install gh-pages --run-dev
or
yarn add gh-pages --run-dev

followed by mannual adding some into package.json scripts section:

 "predeploy": "yarn run build",
 "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",

 after that, in your git repo, go to setting and might be your repo got changed to gh-pages now but if not do it by changing it from default.

 before final commit ,

 npm/yarn run build/deploy.

 aftert that, you can start working and making the change thus you will observe that on github host link.
